##### Reason for the Game & Approach Taken

The Aleph Bet Learning game is a game created to help English speakers learn the Hebrew alphabet by matching the Hebrew characters with the name of that character. The Hebrew alphabet AKA the Aleph Bet is unique in that it is very intuitive. The names of the characters reflect the sound those characters make. For example, B for Bet which makes the "B" sound.

##### Rules of the Game

1. Press Play: Press play to initiate the timer and enable the boards. If you don't click play, you cannot click any of the words or characters.

5. Win: Earn enough points to beat your opponent and win the game!
